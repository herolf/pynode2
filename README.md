PyNode2
===========

This is a rewrite of the pynode written by Jeff Garzik. The goal is to make an
easy to work with Bitcoin (or altcoin) node implementation for network
analysis. Working with Python tends to be much quicker/easier than C++ or
similar systems languages.

Note that this node implementation isn't designed to be used for real
sending/recieving, but more as a malleable tool for education and analysis of
the network.
